# soli

Soli is a django-based web application to help gardeners grow food.  By taking the climate, weather, location, and crop characteristics into account,
Soli is able to create garden plans that capitalize on the growing season and specifics of each plant.  Eventually, the goal is a self-contained garden,
farm, ranch, livestock, and irrigation software that gardeners or farmers can use to make their lives easier by storing and analyzing all of their 
farm's data in one place.  

packages: django, pandas, psycopg, config
